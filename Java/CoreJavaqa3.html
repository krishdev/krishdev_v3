<b>
How to create a thread
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
1. MyThread extends Thread and implement run method <br/>
2. MyThread implements Runnable Interface and override run method <br/>
3. MyThread t = new Mythread("eg");
4. t.start();
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
Different constructors of thread
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Thread(String name);<br/>
Thread(Runnable r, String name);<br/>
Thread(Runnable);<br/>
Thread(String);<br/>
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
Different states of a thread
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
1. New: Once it is instantiated and before start() is called -> New State <br/>
2. Runnable: Once start() method is called, thread enters runnable state. will wait in a runnable queue <br/>
3. Running: Once thread is picked by the scheduler for execution. It can either go to runnable state or wait/sleep/blocked state from here <br/>
4. Wait/Sleep/Blocked: when wait() or sleep() is called or when waiting on a resource<br/>
4. Dead - after it complete execution, thread goes to dead state, when start() is invoked on this RunTimeException occurs
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is Monitor?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
A synchronized block of code on which a thread can obtain a lock. Only one thread can obtain lock to monitor at a time. Once that thread releases the lock, second thread waiting on that object's monitor can obtain the lock

</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is a semaphore?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Semaphore is a shared object which is used for communication between two threads

</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
Thread dump and how to take it
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Thread dump will show all the active threads in JVM. We can analyse thread dump to find if there are any dead locks. Jstack tool used to obtain thread dump

</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
Thread pool
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Thread pool is a pool of worker threads or a colletion of Runnable objects. It has a queue where all tasks to be executed are waiting for execution<br/>
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100); <br/>
executor.execute(New MyRunnable(1)); -> this will add runnable object to the thread pool
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
Runnable, Callable and future?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Runnable - I/F that implements run method, does not return anything<br/>
Callable - I/F that implements run method, can return a generic object <br/>
Future<MyObj> future = executor.submit(New MyCallable(10));
we can use future.get() to get the Myobj instance
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
How to achieve asynchronous programming?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Use Callable and future with executor service interface. once we do a submit, threads are executed asynchronously. does not wait for completion before proceeding to next thread
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is deadlock
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Thread A waiting for resource A and holding resource B. Thread B holding reasource A and waiting for resource B. This is called dead lock - will keep the threads hanging.
How to prevent -> use synchronized blocks and locks
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is atomic operations?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
An operation which has to happpen at a stretch and cannot be stopped in middle. Eg. read - write operations other than long or double. long or double can be atomic only if they are declared volatile

</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is volatile keyword
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Volatile keyword before a variable will make it thread safe. All threads read the variable from memory, cache cannot be created for a volatile variable
</div>
<div class="question">
<b>
How to solve producer - consumer problem
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Use wait() and notify() or BlockingQueue
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
How to share data b/w 2 threads
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
use shared object (with synchronized keyword) or use a blocking queue
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
What is BlockingQueue
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
concurrent.BlockingQueue -> implementation is such that it waits for the queue to be non-empty before removing an item from the queue and waits for the queue to have free space before loading items. It solves the producer-consumer issue
</div>

<div class="question">
<b>
How to avoid concurrency issues or how to make an object immutable?
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Avoid concurrency issues by using immutable classes. Class should be final, all fields private final, no setter method <br/>
Avoid concurrency issues on collections by making a defensive copy and using that, eg. passing a collections.unmodifiableList(list) to another function so that the other function cant change the list
