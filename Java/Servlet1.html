What are Servlets and their advantages
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Servlets are server side java components. They receive the request from HTTP, process it and render the response back to the client <br/>
Advantages of Servers over CGI processes <br/>
Servlets run within the same address space of the server. So it does not require extra memory <br/>
In Servlets, each request is a thread. Where as in CGI its a process. Thread performance is much better than process. <br/>
All features of java available like security, platform independent and oops

Servlet Life cycle
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Load - Servlet is loaded when the application begins (can specify using load-on-startup) or when the servlet is called for the first time. <br/>
Init - the init() method is called after the servlet is loaded, servlet enters the service only after it successfully executes the init method. It is called only once during the life time of servlet <br/>
service - based on the request, either doGet(), doPut(), doDelete() or doPost() method is invoked. For each request, the web container spawns a new request. Override doGet or doPost, cannot override service method<br/>
destroy - when the server is no longer in service or when server shutsdown, the destroy method is called. It is called only once for a servlet, after it is called, the servlet is marked for garbage collection
