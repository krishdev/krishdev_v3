<b>
What is filter
</b></div>
<div class="answer">
Filters are like interceptors. Once implemented each request and response has to pass through the filter chain. One filter completes execution and its result is piped in to the next filter and so on, after the last filter, request/response reaches the specific party.
Generally used for verification/validation of input data or logging/tracking of the response sent out from the servlets
